# Steering File Management Guidelines

## Steering File Modification Rules

### Content Review Requirements
When adding or modifying any steering file, you MUST:

1. **Review ALL existing steering files** before making changes
2. **Check for consistency** across all steering files  
3. **Identify and resolve duplications** between files
4. **Ensure no contradictions** exist between different steering files
5. **Reorganize content** if necessary to maintain clarity and avoid redundancy

### Modification Process
1. **Read all current steering files** to understand the complete rule set
2. **Analyze the new content** for potential conflicts or overlaps
3. **Identify the most appropriate file** for the new content
4. **Check for existing similar rules** that might need updating instead of adding new ones
5. **Consolidate or reorganize** if the addition creates redundancy
6. **Update cross-references** between files if needed

### Content Organization Principles
- **Single source of truth**: Each rule should exist in only one place
- **Logical grouping**: Related rules should be in the same file
- **Clear hierarchy**: More specific rules should reference general ones
- **No contradictions**: All steering files must work together harmoniously

### Quality Assurance
- **Before finalizing changes**: Re-read all steering files to ensure coherence
- **Verify cross-references**: Ensure all file references are accurate
- **Check for gaps**: Ensure no important rules are accidentally removed during reorganization
- **Maintain clarity**: Rules should be clear and unambiguous

This ensures the steering system remains organized, consistent, and effective across all projects and contexts.
